            <h6>Understanding Bluesky: A practical experiment</h6>
            <p>First of all, there are no analytics tools or trackers used here, so feel free to browse away with peace
                of mind. These are the feed topics available here: Recent News, Trending News, Explore, What's Hot,
                Design, Web Development, Developers, Science, Astronomy, Trending, Trending Images, Trending Links,
                Tech, Bluesky Team, Movies, Philosophy, and Popular Profiles.</p>
            <p>This project is a result of exploring Bluesky documentation and utilizing the LLMs. One day, while
                browsing Bluesky posts, I noticed many people building innovative tools on the platform. That inspired
                me to try something similar. To start, I needed to understand how everything worked. This project not
                only helped me grasp the basics but also sparked new ideas during experimentation.</p>
            <p>What's remarkable about Bluesky is its openness. Anyone can bring their unique ideas to life using
                publicly available data. As more individuals and the tech industry start to adopt Bluesky, I think the
                platform's potential is great, and its limitations can only be discovered by launching products and
                pushing boundaries.</p>
            <p>At first glance, this may seem like a simple project, right? I started everything by just sending a test
                post via a Python script. Then I created a Python script with the help of Mistral AI to fetch the raw
                metadata of every post. Eventually, I exported posts from feeds and lists I created, making them
                publicly accessible in a slightly different design. I know that anybody can see these posts in real time
                by just accessing the Bluesky platform itself. But like I said, everything leads to one another. Right
                now, the posts will be updated every two to four hours.</p>
            <p>The whole point was to make the posts last a bit longer and make it accessible to people who just want to
                explore Bluesky. There is also an option to check the real-time post details, as every post includes a
                link to view it directly on Bluesky, its raw data in a downloadable JSON format, the author's profile
                link, and the ability to view images in a new tab just by tapping on them.</p>
            <p>I don't control or take responsibility for the posts shown here. They're from their respective owners and
                update every 2 - 4 hours based on new content. Feel free to crosscheck with the original posts—each one
                is
                properly linked to its author and source.</p>
            <p>For those who don't know, one of the greatest things about Bluesky is that their username is now their
                website. Every username with .bsky.social is a website. You don't need to give the full URL to someone -
                just the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/romiojoseph.github.io/post/3lcscin7ihk2k" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener" alt="Visit username.bsky.social" title="Visit username.bsky.social">
                    username.bsky.social</a>, and it will redirect.</p>
            <P>Essentially, every regular user now has a website, along with an RSS feed.</P>
            <p>This project, along with my other—an RSS Feed Reader web application—has inspired me to explore ways to
                make news consumption more tailored to my preferences.</p>
            <p>I really hope and expect more people to adopt Bluesky soon.</p>
