            <h6>Understanding Bluesky</h6>
            <p>First of all, there are no analytics tools or trackers used here, so feel free to browse away with peace
                of mind. These are the feed topics available here: Recent News, Web Development, Science,
                Astronomy, Trending Links, Tech, Bluesky Team, Movies, and Popular Profiles.</p>
            <p>This project is a result of exploring Bluesky documentation and utilizing the LLMs. One day, while
                browsing Bluesky posts, I noticed many people building innovative tools on the platform. That inspired
                me to try something similar. To start, I needed to understand how everything worked. This project not
                only helped me grasp the basics but also sparked new ideas during experimentation.</p>
            <p>What's remarkable about Bluesky is its openness. Anyone can bring their unique ideas to life using
                publicly available data. As more individuals and the tech industry start to adopt Bluesky, I think the
                platform's potential is great, and its limitations can only be discovered by launching products and
                pushing boundaries.</p>
            <p>At first glance, this may seem like a simple project, right? I started everything by just sending a test
                post via a Python script. Then I created a Python script with the help of Mistral AI to fetch the raw
                metadata of every post. Eventually, I exported posts from feeds and lists I created, making them
                publicly accessible in a slightly different design. I know that anybody can see these posts in real time
                by just accessing the Bluesky platform itself. But like I said, everything leads to one another.</p>
            <p>The whole point was to make it accessible to people who just want to explore Bluesky. There is also an
                option to check the real-time post details, as every post includes a link to view it directly on
                Bluesky, its raw data in viewable and downloadable JSON format, the author's profile
                link, and the ability to view images in a new tab just by tapping on them.</p>
            <p>I don't control or take responsibility for the posts shown here. They're from their respective owners.
                Feel free to crosscheck with the original posts. Each one is properly linked to its author and source.
            </p>
            <p>For those who don't know, one of the greatest things about Bluesky is that their username is now their
                website. Every username with .bsky.social is a website. You don't need to give the full URL to someone -
                just the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/romiojoseph.github.io/post/3lcscin7ihk2k" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener" alt="Visit username.bsky.social" title="Visit username.bsky.social">
                    username.bsky.social</a>, and it will redirect.</p>
            <P>Essentially, every regular user now has a website, along with an RSS feed.</P>
            <p>This project, along with my other (an RSS Feed Reader web application) has inspired me to explore ways
                to
                make news consumption more tailored to my preferences.</p>
            <p>I really hope and expect more people to adopt Bluesky soon.</p>
