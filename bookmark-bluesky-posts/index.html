            <h5>Bluesky Open Bookmark Feed</h5>
            <p>I'm on a streak of building simple things with Bluesky open data, and this is one of them. As of today,
                the platform still doesn't have a native bookmarking option for posts. But it has a feed to view posts
                that we replied to using a pin emoji. It is useful, but I didn't like that approach. For a while, I used
                to save posts that I wanted to revisit later using my <a
                    href="https://github.com/romiojoseph/open-source/tree/main/telegram-bots/telegram-to-raindrop"
                    target="_blank" title="Telegram to Raindrop bot link" rel="noopener">Telegram-to-Raindrop bot</a>.
                Then, I started
                saving them in my Telegram saved messages. But like everything, after a point, everything starts to pile
                up, which means that the first impression wears out, and we start to expect more use cases and focused
                solutions. That's when I started to think about a Telegram bot to save these posts.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's only been a few days since I started being able to export raw metadata from Bluesky using their
                Open API. I tried to make a script several times using different AI tools, I don't know why, but until
                recently, I always faced errors. I'm not sure if it's because tools like Claude, Mistral, and Gemini
                have improved or if their knowledge cutoffs have expanded, but they started producing scripts that
                better matched my requirements. This helped me build <a href="https://github.com/romiojoseph/bluesky"
                    target="_blank" title="Bluesky projects" rel="noopener">a few simple websites</a> using the output
                data.

            <h6>Bookmark Bluesky Posts Using a Telegram Bot</h6>
            <p>
                It was a very difficult process for me to build this specific bot as I don't have knowledge of coding.
                But after several attempts and by reading the post structure several times, I was able to tell exactly
                what I needed to these AI tools. No AI could produce a completely working script. This is the result of
                working and troubleshooting with multiple AI products.
            </p>
            <p>The main task is debugging and checking for every kind of possible scenario. I had to create many
                versions. Yes, I know for a person familiar with programming, this could be built in a few hours, but it
                took me 2 days plus changes. But hey, I'm happy with the result so far because many times I wanted to
                abandon this project, but I still managed to launch it as I wanted—thanks to the amazing progress of AI.

            <h6>Footnote</h6>
            <p>
                This bot extracts post metadata and saves it to a Google Sheet, which I've published as a CSV and
                connected to this website. Whenever I send a post link to the bot and assign it a category, it
                automatically appears in the feed within a few seconds. The goal was to create curated feeds using posts
                that I like or find interesting.
            </p>
            <p>I know the Bluesky team is currently working on a bookmark feature, and it could launch any day now—I
                have a strong feeling about that. Still, I wanted something done my way, and now I have it.</p>
            <p>Please note: If a user changes or deletes their profile picture, image, or video, it will no longer be
                available here. However, text-based data will remain as it appears in the sheet. Posts with deleted
                media will be removed manually, as I notice them, to respect the user's privacy. All media-related items
