            Bluesky offers incredible flexibility. If someone wanted an Instagram-like client tailored to individual
            preferences, it's entirely possible to build one (I'm not quite there yet). This project explores that idea.
            With Bluesky now supporting video, creating short-form and long-form video feeds (Yes, YouTube like apps!)
            also seems likely in the future. The platform's openness is amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this project, I looked for a better image feed but couldn't find one that matched everyone's
            preferences. So, I created a feed with categories like astronomy, photography, nature, art, travel, animals,
            birds, etc. I wanted to create a feed with specific hashtags, but one issue I faced is that some people add
            a ton of hashtags—many of which are irrelevant to the post—just to increase reach. Until I have better
            control over the feed, I welcome any unique hashtags.
        </p>
        <p>
            I added labels to filter out unsuitable and offensive posts from this feed. However, I'm not fully confident
            it works as intended. Posts with any value in the Label column of the post metadata are excluded from this
            project but may still appear in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/romiojoseph.github.io/feed/aaadvp6teeh3k"
                rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bluesky's native client feed</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Sorting is based on HN ranking with a gravity of 1.8. User actions like repost, like, and reply will redirect
            you to Bluesky. This isn't a client but an Instagram-like feed that updates every two to four hours to
            provide an Instagram-like experience. The like, repost, and reply counts may differ from the original post
            due to periodic updates.
        </p>
        <p>I don't control or take responsibility for the posts shown here. They're from their respective owners. Feel
            free to crosscheck with the original posts—each one is properly linked to its author and source.
        </p>
        <p>Javascript is entriely created using LLMs like Claude Sonnet and Google Gemini. I built this to make Bluesky
            accessible to people who prefer not to sign up or log in (but I highly recommend creating an account, as
            Bluesky has the potential to become a better platform). Now about this project, unlike other social media
            apps, you can explore freely without having your actions or scrolls tracked or monitored. No analytics or
            trackers are used here, so you can browse with peace of mind.
        </p>
        <p>Another Bluesky project of mine - Spotligt Feeds - offering a tracker-free feed with topics like Recent
            News, Trending News, Science, Movies, Tech, Web Development, and more.</p>
